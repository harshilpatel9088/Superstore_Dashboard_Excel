## Features

1. **Data Cleaning**
   Data cleaning is a critical step in any data analysis process. The following tasks were performed to ensure the data was accurate and ready for analysis:
   - **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing values by using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal.
   - **Standardizing Formats**: Ensured consistency in date formats, text cases, and numerical entries.
   - **Data Validation**: Implemented data validation rules to maintain the accuracy and quality of the data.

3. **Using VLOOKUPs**
   VLOOKUPs were utilized to efficiently combine and retrieve data from multiple sources. The primary tasks included:
   - **Merging Data Sets**: Combined data from different tables by matching unique identifiers.
   - **Retrieving Information**: Pulled relevant information from one table into another based on a common key.
   - **Error Handling**: Used the IFERROR function to manage errors and provide default values when lookups failed.

4. **Creating KPIs with Pivot Tables**
   Pivot tables were employed to create dynamic and insightful KPIs. The steps involved were:
   - **Data Aggregation**: Summarized large data sets to extract meaningful patterns and trends
   - **KPI Development**: Defined and calculated KPIs such as total sales, average order value, and customer retention rates.
   - **Data Visualization**: Enhanced the presentation of KPIs using conditional formatting and charts to highlight key insights.
   - **Interactivity**: Added slicers and filters to enable users to interact with the dashboard and explore data from different perspectives.
